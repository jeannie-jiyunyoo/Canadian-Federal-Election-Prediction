Data Analysis in Canadian Federal Election Prediction

Forecasting election has been drawing attention from academia and public to predict the outcome of the election that impacts the society in the future. While there exists several methods of prediction from political perspective to data-driven approach, it is important to utilize accurate method to analyze the election data in a unbiased environment. Since it is crucial to have reasonable standards to use in determining the advantage of various models, here we explore the General Social Survey (GSS) as the “census” data (Technology, Computing in the Humanities and Social Sciences 2019), and data from the CES2019 package as “survey” data (Government of Canada, 2017). Given the data resources available from Canadian Election Study, Phone Survey data for the year 2019, it is reasonable to hypothesize that Conservative party would win based on the overall popular vote of the previous Canadian federal election.
